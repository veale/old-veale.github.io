**Responsible public sector machine learning**

`status:ongoing` `type:PhD` `funder:EPSRC`

Machine learning, a set of technologies that identify and utilise patterns in data, is seeing more operational use in the public sector. Areas of current deployment include taxation, policing, child protection, food safety and justice. Yet responsible use of machine learning must sidestep issues of fairness, accountability, transparency, reliability, legality, liability and more. Technical tools are being developed to help here, but these won't work if they're airdropped in. I study the social aspects of the deployment of fairer and more responsible machine learning systems, with the aim of understanding how to do it better. I do this by

- interviewing public sector actors to understand how ethics do (or don't) get into public sector machine learning today.
- engaging in action research within the public sector to develop and test social and technical tools for more responsible public sector machine learning tomorrow.
